# Logistic-Regression-
Implementing a logistic regression program to predict whether a patient has heart disease or not based on some features.

Write a python program in which you:
  a- Use these 4 features (trestbps, chol, thalach & oldpeak) as input and the
  output to be predicted is the “target”.
  b- Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
  c- Use sklearn’s logistic regression to build a model that fits the training
  data. Then, use that model to predict the output of the test data and print
  the error of the model.
  d- Implement logistic regression (from scratch) using gradient descent to
  optimize the parameters of the hypothesis function.
  e- Use the optimized hypothesis function to make predictions on new data.
  f- Calculate the cost (error) in every iteration to see how the error of the
  hypothesis function changes with every iteration of gradient descent.
  g- Plot the cost against the number of iterations.
